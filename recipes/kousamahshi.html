    <h2> How to make Kousa Mahshi:</h2>
    <p>Wash the zucchinis and core them. Rinse the rice and drain. Then, place it in a glass bowl. Add the minced meat
        to the
        rice. Top the rice and minced meat with spices and salt.</p>
    <p>Melt the butter and add it to the rice/meat mixture. Use your hands or a spoon to mix the stuffing ingredients
        really
        well.</p>
    <p>Start stuffing each cored zucchini (until you reach Â¾ to its opening). Close each piece with a tomato chunk and
        place it
        in a large cooking pot. Once all the stuffed zucchinis are in the pot, add enough water to cover them. Bring the
        stuffed
        zucchinis to a boil for around 10-15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Mix the tomato paste with a little bit of water. Add the tomato paste to the pot with 2 bay leaves. Season with
        salt to
        taste. Simmer the stuffed zucchinis on low to medium heat for about 30-45 minutes. Remove from heat and serve
        hot.</p>
    <h3> Enjoy!</h3>
