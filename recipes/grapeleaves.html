    <h1>Stuffed Grape Leaves!</h1>
    <p>Grape leaves originated in the Middle East where rice and meat is placed in grape leaves which are then wrapped
        creating an absolutely delicious meal </p>

    <h2> Step 1: Prepare the Grape Leaves </h2>
    <p>We're using jarred grape leaves in brine, no cooking needed. But before using in this recipe, remove them from
        the jar
        and rinse well. Let them drain in a colander while you prepare the stuffing.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Stuffing</h2>
    <p>The stuffing here is made of rice, cooked ground beef, and a few chopped fresh herbs (parsley, dill, and mint).
    </p>
    <p>First, rinse the rice and soak in water for 20 minutes (this is an important step, read on for more tips.) Then
        drain
        well. And while the rice is soaking cook the meat. Sautee finely chopped onions, add the meat and cook until
        fully
        browned. Be sure to drain any excess fat, then season the meat with kosher salt and pepper, allspice and cumin
        (so
        tasty!) Let cool. Combine the meat, rice, and fresh herbs. Add a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
        and toss to combine. Add pinch of salt.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Stuff and Roll Grape Leaves</h2>
    <p>Lightly oil the pot with some extra virgin olive oil, then add a few layers of grape leaves and top with sliced
        tomatoes. This protects the stuffed grape leaves touching the bottom of the pot from scorching.
        To stuff grape leaves, work one leaf at a time. Lay the leaf flat on a cutting board with the more textured side
        facing
        you. Cut off the stem.
        Take a heaping teaspoon of the rice stuffing mixture (a little bit less than 1 tablespoon) and place in the
        center of
        the leaf (close to where stem was). Fold the sides over the filling and roll, keep tucking the left and right
        sides as you roll
        Fold and roll grape leaves tightly enough but not too tight so the rice has room to expand as it cooks.</p>
    <h2>Step 4: Assemble Grape Leaves in Cooking Pot</h2>
    <p>Neatly arrange the grape leaves in rows, seam-side down, in your prepared pot, covering the circumference of the
        pot.
        Then place a small plate inverted on top (this helps keep them in place while cooking.) Boil the water or broth
        and pour
        over the grape leaves, arriving at the top layer and somewhat covering (about 4 cups liquid, maybe a little
        more.)
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5: Cook Grape Leaves on Stovetop</h2>
    <p>Cover the pot with its lid and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes until the liquid has been absorbed. Uncover
        and
        remove the plate, then pour juice of 2 lemons. Cover again with the lid (no need for the plate at this point),
        cook on
        low heat for 30 to 45 more minutes or until fully cooked.Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes, uncovered, before
        transferring to serving platter.</p>

    <h3> Enjoy!</h3>
