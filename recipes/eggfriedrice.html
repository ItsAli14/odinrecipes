    <h2> Method:</h2>
    <p>
        STEP 1
        Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 2
        Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around
        5 mins.
        Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 3
        Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir
        vigorously
        to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and
        stirring
        through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground
        white
        pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.</p>
