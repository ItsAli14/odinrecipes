    <h1> Biryani!</h1>
    <img src="../img/biryani.jpg" alt="Delicious Biryani">
    <p>The word Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, which means
        ‘fried before cooking’ and Birinj, the Persian
        word for rice. There are various theories related to the origin of this s
        crumptious dish. Many historians believe that
        biryani originated from Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals.</p>
    <p> Essentially biryani is long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices
        such as saffron and layered with lamb, chicken, fish,vegetables
        and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, and
        then the biryani is cooked over a low flame</p>
    <h2> How to make it?</h2>
    <p> Method: Soak almond for 10 minutes and then remove the peel. Then grind almond with ginger and garlic and make a
        smooth
        paste. Wash the rice and boil it until the rice is almost done. Strain rice and set aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of
        oil in
        a pan and fry two of the onions until they are golden brown. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in another pan and add
        the whole
        spices - cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and peppercorns. Fry the mixture until the spices turn a little darker. Add
        onions
        and fry them until they are translucent. Add the ginger-garlic-almond paste and fry for two to three minutes.
        Now, add
        all the spice powders -- coriander, cumin and garam masala and mix well. Fry the mixture until the oil begins to
        separate from the masala and then add the lamb or chicken. Continue frying until the meat is fully sealed; it
        will
        become opaque and lose its pink color. Add the yogurt, lime juice, stock, coriander and mint leaves and salt to
        taste
        and mix well. Cover the pot and allow the dish to cook until the meat is tender. Grease a deep baking dish and
        evenly
        layer the cooked rice and meat to form two sets of layers. Cover the dish tightly. Put the dish in a preheated
        oven set
        at 350 F. Bake for 20 minutes. Mughlai Biryani is ready to be served.</p>
